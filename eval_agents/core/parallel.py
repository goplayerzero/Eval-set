"""parallel.py

Lightweight placeholder implementation for `ParallelTestRunner` used by
`eval_agents.core.repo`.  In the current simplified workflow we run tests
sequentially, but `ParallelTestRunner` keeps the public interface stable for
future parallel execution.

If you later need real parallelism you can swap in a multiprocessing or
async-based implementation without touching callers.
